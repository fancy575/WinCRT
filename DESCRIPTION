Title: Win Ratio for Cluster-Randomized Trials with Hierarchical or Single Endpoints
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Xi",  family = "Fang", email = "x.fang@yale.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
      person(given = "Fan", family = "Li",   email = "fan.f.li@yale.edu", role = "aut"))
Description: 
    Tools to compute win/loss/tie tallies and win-ratio statistics in
    cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) with hierarchical endpoints or a single
    endpoint. The function
    supports survival-style data and non-survival
    single endpoints. Inference is provided via t- or z-tests for
    multiple estimands (log win ratio, log win odds, and net win proportion),
    with summaries at the subject and cluster level.
